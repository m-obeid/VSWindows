> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music... 

## Kade Engine
V.S. Windows uses Kade Engine for Friday Night Funkin', including a full engine rework, replays, and more.
**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

If you're looking for documentation, changelogs, or guides about the engine, you can find those on the Kade Engine website.

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can customize the keybinds to any keys you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.

# V.S. Windows exlusive features

- **Added Test to the Freeplay Menu**
   - Now you can play the hidden test track very easily, even with more detail.
- **Anti-Piracy Screen**
   - To protect against websites like KBH Games and so on. 
   - It only let's desktop through, so if you want to port this mod, you have to get my permission.
- **Easter eggs**
   - I added some unused stuff, you might easily find it.
- **Week ü™ü**
   - Yeah, I think that's obvious...
